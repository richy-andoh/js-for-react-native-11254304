## Task 1: Process Array
- Created a JavaScript file named `arrayManipulation.js`.
- Wrote a function `processArray` that takes an array of numbers as an argument.
- The function returns a new array where each even number is squared and each odd number is tripled.

## Task 2: Format Array Strings
- Added a function `formatArrayStrings` to `arrayManipulation.js`.
- The function takes an array of strings and an array of numbers processed by `processArray`.
- It modifies each string based on its corresponding number: capitalize if the number is even, convert to lowercase if the number is odd.

## Task 3: Create User Profiles
- Created a JavaScript file named `userInfo.js`.
- Wrote a function `createUserProfiles` that takes an array of names and the array of modified names from Task 2.
- The function returns an array of objects, each containing `originalName`, `modifiedName`, and `id` (auto-incremented starting from 1).
